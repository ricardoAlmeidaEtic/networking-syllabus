## **Session 5: Networking Security Basics**

### **Summary**  
This session covers the basics of securing networks, focusing on encryption, firewalls, and common vulnerabilities that web applications may face.

### **Topics**  
1. **Encryption**  
   - **Symmetric Encryption**: Same key for encryption and decryption.  
   - **Asymmetric Encryption**: Public and private keys, used in HTTPS (SSL/TLS).

2. **Firewalls**  
   - **Network Firewalls**: Filter traffic entering and leaving a network.  
   - **Application Firewalls**: Protect individual applications (e.g., web servers).

3. **Common Network Vulnerabilities**  
   - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Interception of communication.  
   - **DDoS Attacks**: Distributed Denial of Service, overwhelming a server with traffic.

### **Exercises**  
- **Easy**: Learn how to configure a simple firewall rule in `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Linux.  
- **Intermediate**: Write an essay about common DDoS mitigation techniques.  
- **Difficult**: Implement SSL/TLS on a web application to secure communications.
