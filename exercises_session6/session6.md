## **Session 6: Advanced Networking Tools**

### **Summary**  
In this session, we explore advanced networking tools used for performance monitoring, traffic analysis, and security.

### **Topics**  
1. **Wireshark**  
   - A network protocol analyzer that lets you capture and inspect network packets.  
   - Common uses include monitoring HTTP traffic and identifying vulnerabilities.

2. **Nmap**  
   - A network scanning tool to discover devices and services on a network.  
   - Useful for security assessments and network mapping.

3. **Netcat**  
   - A versatile networking tool used for reading and writing data across network connections.

   **Resources**:  
   - [Wireshark Documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/)  
   - [Nmap Documentation](https://nmap.org/book/)

### **Exercises**  
- **Easy**: Install Wireshark and capture traffic on your local network.  
- **Intermediate**: Use Nmap to scan your local network and discover active hosts.  
- **Difficult**: Capture and analyze HTTPS traffic (with proper certificates) to identify encryption settings.
